# tuiscope

## TuiScope

Inspired by [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).

A TUI fuzzy finder for rust apps. For example usage, see [examples](https://github.com/olidacombe/tuiscope/tree/main/examples).

## Performance

If you're dealing with large amounts of data (say 1,000,000 strings), performance is poor with
debug builds.  Release builds are still snappy.
